  Angular uses modules to organize an application. It is not the same as ES modules.  
  
* **ES Modules**  
  ES modules are used to organize code.  
  
* **Decorator**  
  Decorators add additional functionality to classes. In angular it is the MetaData. Angular has built in decorators. Syntax:  
  `@DecoratorName({  
    DecoratorProp:DecoratorValue  
   })  
   export class ClassName{}`  
   
* **Typescript**  
  Angular is mostly used with typescript. Its a strongly typed language with OOP features.  
  
* **Component**  
  Angular consists of components. Every component is a class with the Component decorator. Syntax:  
   `@Component({  
      selector: "custom-html-element",  
      templateUrl: "./my.component.html"  
   })  
   export class MyComponent{}`  
   
## Convention  
* Modules are named like **NameModule**.
